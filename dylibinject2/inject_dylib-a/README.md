## inject_dylib

Inject_dylib (indy) allows you to load a dynamic library and call a function in
another process. Indy currently supports targetting 32-bit and 64-bit x86
processes, interoperates with the sandbox, and has been tested on OS X 10.10.

```C
#include "indy.h"

// In your injector process:
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    const char *str = "Hello world!";

    struct indy_result res;
    indy_inject(&(struct indy_info) {
        .pid = 1234,
        .dylib_path = "/path/to/libfoo.dylib",
        .dylib_entry_symbol = "foo_entry",
        .user_data = (const void *) str,
        .user_data_size = strlen(str) + 1
    }, &res);
    if (res.error != NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, res.error, res.os_value);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    return res.exit_status;
}

// And in your injected dynamic library:
uint32_t foo_entry(void *user_data)
{
    printf("%s\n", (char *) user_data);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Security restrictions

For your application to be able to do code injection, it needs to be code
signed by a certificate in the system keychain. Either create a self-signed
certificate in the system keychain and reboot, or sign up for the Apple
Developer program to get an Apple signed certificate. The latter is probably a
requirement if you wish to distribute your application.

In addition, add the following key to your application `Info.plist`:

```XML
<key>SecTaskAccess</key>
<array>
    <string>allowed</string>
</array>
```

Alternatively, you can use a privileged helper. Either way, it is probably wise
to restrict this kind of access to a separate helper executable within your
application bundle.

The injector process currently cannot have App Sandbox enabled.

### Technical details

Indy is inspired by [mach_inject], but takes a very different approach,
abstracts away more details, and adds support for different target achitectures
and the app sandbox.

Indy copies a small architecture specific loader into the target process, which
does roughly the following:

```C
extern struct indy_info info;
extern char *dylib_token;
extern uint32_t exit_status;

void loader()
{
    sandbox_extension_consume(dylib_token);
    void *handle = dlopen(info.dylib_path, RTLD_LOCAL);
    if (handle != NULL) {
        indy_entry entry = dlsym(handle, info.dylib_entry_symbol);
        if (entry != NULL)
            exit_status = entry(info.user_data);
        dlclose(handle);
    }
}
```

Indy hides much of the intricate detail from the user. This listing excludes
architecture specific setup. Before the above code runs, a proper pthread is
created. By using regular dynamic loader calls, the library is free to pull
in other library dependencies.

The loader code, info structure and runtime data are all allocated in a single
block. This block is automatically deallocated when the code finishes.

To find the various system functions in the target process address space, indy
looks for the dynamic loader first, and uses its debugger interface to iterate
libraries. Indy then parses Mach-O to locate the actual functions and creates a
table for the loader to reference. The functions used in the loader are all
libSystem functions, which are currently guaranteed to be linked into every
process on OS X.

### Release notes

##### v0.2.2 - 2015-07-30

Expanded sandbox private interface header.

##### v0.2.1 - 2015-07-28

Fixes to i386 support.

##### v0.2.0 - 2015-07-28

Rework of API:

 - Most significantly, `indy_inject` is now a blocking call that
   doesn't exit until the injected code does. This simplifies cleanup a lot. 
 - An exit status is returned back to the injector.
 - The Mach communication port was removed.
 - The entry point now directly takes user data.

##### v0.1.0 - 2015-07-22

Initial release.
